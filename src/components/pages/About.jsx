            I am a brazilian software developer. I am pursuing a degree in
            systems analysis and development at Instituto Federal do Tri√¢ngulo
            Mineiro, Brazil. Currently, my main focus is to acquire the
            knowledge to create softwares from scratch by understanding all the
            processes.

            In my spare time, I like to take part in programming marathons and
            solve coding challenges on platforms such as congenial, beecrowd and
            codeforces. When I'm not at the computer, I'm usually hiking,
            running around the city or reading books.
